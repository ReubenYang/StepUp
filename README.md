# StepUp
An event organized by DataKind and SAS DataDive. 

**Background:** StepUp Durham aims to analyze seven years of internal participant and donor data in order to optimize the delivery of employment training and life skills workshops. In analyzing this data, StepUp is seeking to gain insight on a) how to staff and resource these workshops and b) how to optimize the content of their curriculum. In addition, they are seeking to create a model to predict positive outcomes from the various programs and isolate variables for success so that all individuals seeking full-time work can obtain the skills needed to attain gainful employment.

**Objective:** StepUp Durham would like to understand what factors predict completion of workshop and what factors predict success in finding a job.  Also important is to understand characteristics of participants that do not succeed. Are there common factors that can predict who will be successful in completing the program, obtaining employment, etc?
